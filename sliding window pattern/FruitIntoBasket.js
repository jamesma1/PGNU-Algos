// You are visiting a farm to collect fruits.The farm has a single row of fruit trees.
// You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

// You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree.
// The farm has following restrictions:

// Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
// You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

// level: medium
